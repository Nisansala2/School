     <h2 className='history-h'>Our Beginning</h2>
     <p className='history'>Athapathukanda Viddayala which was estabilished in the year 1959.It is located in Athapattukanda rural area of Deiyandra town,Matara distric
        Sourthen province.Eventhough it is started with only fifty students and a staff of two teachers. It has been started primarly for the rural children.
        Currently this school is developing and has become a school operating under green concept.<br/> <br/>
 Mr.D.A Danapala was started in and he was also the first principle.Thisschool, which started with only one classroom,today we can see acadamic bulding,computer lab, maths lab,physisc lab,sceience lab, music room, library and other special building under the green cohncept The class texts were imported from England. “Reading and Thinking” was the reader that was used in the Primary section. Sinhala language was naturally taught as a subject, but both the subject and the teacher herself did not receive the recognition they deserved.<br/><br/> The standard of English was definitely high. In addition to the standard curriculum there was much time devoted to music, dancing and drama. Almost every term ending was marked by a concert, one of which was of so high standard that it was staged at the Broadway Theater. The school was conducted in two sessions unlike now, with a lunch break of 45 minutes. The sanitary conditions of the school were excellent. There was no water on tap and the broad well at the back there for washing purposes.

In 1936, the number of students had increased and therefore the usages of physical properties also were increased. The land and old house, which situated in Gabadaweediya was made as a School. It was steadily increased from class to class upward from the lowest. In that period Dr.Gunarwardana was passed away. It was a big loss to Sujatha. After all it was difficult period to school as the stability of the Buddhist society was broken down. It was great bless to school as Mr.Ariyarathna accepted the managerial post and he made all arrangements to pay salaries for the school teachers from his own money. </p>
